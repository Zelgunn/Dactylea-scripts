# Dactylea

Dactylea is a didactic chemistry simulation in VR. With the help of Fabienne, Dactylea's AI, make a Pharao's Serpent.  
You can talk to Fabienne, she may not understand everything but she will do her best to help you. For example, you can ask her to repeat the last instructions or to explain you what you should do next.  
Be careful when manipulating chemicals, Ethanol burns and glass breaks. You have to finish the simulation without doing any mistake !  

Dactylea was made for the [LAMPA laboratory](http://lampa.ensam.eu/).
Here is the [presentation video (on Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghqWI-w7M_k).

Most graphical elements were made by Emilien Grude.
